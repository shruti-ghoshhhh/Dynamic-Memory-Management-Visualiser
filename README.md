📌 Project Description
This Dynamic Memory Management Visualizer is an interactive web tool that demonstrates how memory allocation and deallocation work in operating systems. It helps users understand how different memory allocation strategies (First Fit, Best Fit, and Worst Fit) impact memory usage.

🎯 Features
✅ Memory Initialization: Users can enter the total available memory size to simulate real-world memory allocation.

✅ Process Allocation: Users can allocate memory blocks dynamically using First Fit, Best Fit, or Worst Fit strategies.

✅ Deallocation: Users can release memory blocks by entering the allocated block ID.

✅ Real-time Visualization: The memory allocation is animated to showcase how blocks are allocated and freed.

✅ Dark Mode UI: A modern, dark-themed interface for better readability and aesthetics.

✅ Hover Effects & Animations: Smooth transitions, glowing buttons, and memory block effects for an engaging experience.


🛠️ How It Works
1️⃣ Initialize Memory → Enter the total memory size and click “Initialize.”

2️⃣ Allocate Memory → Enter a process size, select an allocation strategy, and click “Allocate.”

3️⃣ Deallocate Memory → Enter the block ID and click “Deallocate.”

4️⃣ Observe Memory Changes → Watch how memory is split, allocated, and merged dynamically.


📚 Learning Outcomes
🔹 Understand dynamic memory management in operating systems.

🔹 Learn how First Fit, Best Fit, and Worst Fit strategies allocate memory.

🔹 Visualize memory fragmentation and the importance of efficient allocation.
💻 Perfect for students, developers, and anyone interested in learning about memory management in a fun, interactive way! 🚀
